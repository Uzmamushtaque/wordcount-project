<h1>Hi, thanks for visiting my site.</h1>
          <p>I have a PhD degree in Decision Sciences and Engineering Systems from RPI (Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute) Troy, NY. I am passionate about working on challenging problems in the field of statistical (and machine) learning and data analytics. My PhD and Postdoctoral research finds direct application in online retail and subscription entertainment platforms like Amazon and Netflix. My dissertation work is at the intersection of four fields: (1) online recommender systems (2) consumer choice models, (3) supply chain models, and (4) assortment planning. In my academic research I developed mathematical models for personalized online recommendations capturing different context-effects associated with individual user selection behavior.

          In order to analyze the developed mathematical decision tools I utilized big data sets (MovieLens, Amazon Product Review, Online Retail dataset at UCI Repository etc.). My thesis included an in-depth, iterative and methodical exploration of some of the very Big-Datasets available for consumer preference ratings. My future research incudes incorporating better mathematical representations of consumer behavior as a result of choice-context via data-driven/ non-parametric approaches and using data analytics to improve consumer choice models. In my Postdoctoral research work I built Machine Learning models using travel survey data to better predict customer location choice. My background in engineering, work experience in consulting, a Masters in Supply Chain, and my academic research motivates the inter-disciplinary nature of my research interests. My 2 years of teaching assistant experience and current full time Lecturer experience in computer science, statistics/machine learning, operations research, optimization and simulation has equipped me with in-depth conceptual clarity required to apply these skills to real world problems.

          <p>Currently, I teach Computer Science 1 (Python Programming), Foundations of Computer Science (FOCS)
          and Machine Learning with Data.</p>
